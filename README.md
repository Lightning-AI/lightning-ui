# Lightning UI

[![CI Testing](https://github.com/gridai/lightning-ui/actions/workflows/ci-testing.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/gridai/lightning-ui/actions/workflows/ci-testing.yaml)
[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/Lightning-AI/lightning-ui/master.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/Lightning-AI/lightning-ui/master)

This project contains the source code for the Lightning app frontend. The frontend is a scaffold which reacts to change
in the app's internal state and renders components accordingly.

## Development

### Required Tools

- NodeJS 16.13.1+
- Yarn 1.22.17+
- Python 3.8+ (for `lightning` CLI)

### Commands

All commands are defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

- **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
- **Install pre-commit hooks:**
    ```bash
    yarn husky install
    ```
- **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    yarn run test
    ```
- **Run tests interactively:**
    ```bash
    yarn run test:open
    ```

### Integration with Lightning CLI

This frontend is meant to be started from the `lightning` CLI, and also consumes the API server which it exposes.

To set up both projects together, follow the steps below:

- **Clone and build frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd $HOME
    git clone git@github.com:gridai/lightning-ui.git
    cd lightning-ui
    yarn install
    yarn husky install
    yarn build
    ```
- **Clone and run CLI:** (in a separate terminal)
    ```bash
    cd $HOME
    git clone git@github.com:PyTorchLightning/lightning.git
    cd lightning
    python -m venv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
    ln -s ./lightning/lightning/ui $HOME/lightning-ui/build
    lighting start app ./examples/layout/demo.py
    ```

The `lightning` CLI will now serve the frontend code at `http://localhost:7501`. Any time you make changes to the
frontend code, simply run `yarn build` again, and refresh the browser window to see the changes.

## How do I release a new local UI version for the Lightning.ai framework?

The `lightning-ui` release process is automated with GitHub actions and being published to S bucket or as artifact to eventual GH release.

### Automated releasing

We are building the UI for two occasion - creating GH release in UI or pushing any tag to git and then it is uploaded do S3 with the names used as the tag. (Note that making release in Github yields in making tag with the same name.) 

### Manual releasing

In a gase you really have to:

```shell
yarn build
tar -czvf build.tar.gz ./build
```

with:
- **c**: This stands for "create." It tells tar that you want to create a new archive.
- **z**: This option is used to compress the archive using gzip compression. When you specify z, tar will compress the archive while creating it, resulting in a .tar.gz (or .tgz) archive file.
- **v**: This stands for "verbose." When you include v, tar will display information about the files being archived as it processes them.
- **f**: This option specifies the filename for the archive.

Then, upload the file to [this bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/grid-packages/lightning-ui/v0.0.0;tab=objects?pli=1&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false) and overwrite existing.

~~New releases of the Lightning.ai framework happen automatically from a GitHub action with every merge to `master`. This will download and include the `lightning-ui` that is in the bucket above.~~
